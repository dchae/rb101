# Understand the problem
# Questions:
#   - Only string inputs? i.e. do we need to sanitise inputs
#   - Do spaces count?

# Input: string
# Output: array of substrings
# Rules:
#   Explicit requirements:
#   - every palindrome in the string must be returned
#   - palindromes are case sensitive
#   Implicit requirements:
#   - return in an array
#   - no palindromes in string returns empty array
#   - palindromes are at least two chars long
